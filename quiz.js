Reading:
In the small town of Eldenwick, nestled in the shadow of the Mistspire Mountains, strange rumors had been circulating for decades. Locals spoke of an ancient artifact hidden deep within the mountains—a crystal capable of bending time itself. Known as the Crystal of Eternity, it was said to grant unimaginable power to anyone who possessed it. Yet, with such power came a grave curse: the crystal would show its wielder the future, but never allow them to change it.
Lina, a curious and determined adventurer, had always been drawn to the tales of the crystal. After years of research and whispers in forgotten libraries, she discovered a half-burned map hinting at the crystal's location. On a cold autumn morning, she packed her gear, leaving Eldenwick behind as she ventured into the mountains.
The journey was perilous. The Mistspire Mountains were known for their unpredictable weather and treacherous cliffs. On her third day, Lina stumbled across an ancient stone bridge guarded by a riddle etched into its surface:
"To pass beyond, the truth you must find. Time moves forward, but leaves what behind?"
Lina pondered the question for hours. Finally, she whispered, "Memories," and the bridge rumbled to life, allowing her passage. Beyond the bridge lay a cave glowing faintly with an eerie blue light. Inside, the walls shimmered as if coated with liquid stars.
In the center of the cavern stood a pedestal, and atop it sat the Crystal of Eternity. It pulsed gently, filling the air with a hum that resonated in Lina's chest. As she approached, the crystal began to glow brighter, and an image materialized within its core: Lina herself, older, sitting in Eldenwick, surrounded by people in mourning.
A voice echoed in the cavern, soft yet firm. "The future cannot be changed, but your choices shape the journey. Take the crystal, and bear its weight—or leave it, and walk another path."
Lina hesitated. The future shown to her was grim, yet her heart burned with curiosity. Was it worth the risk? She reached out her hand, trembling, as the scene faded into darkness.
